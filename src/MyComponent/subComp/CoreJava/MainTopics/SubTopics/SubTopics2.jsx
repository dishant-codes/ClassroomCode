          &nbsp;&nbsp;Usually computer languages are either interpreted or
          compiled, Java combined both these approaches that makes Java to stage
          system. Java source code translated into bytecode inspection bytecode
          are not machine instruction for in 2nd stage Java interpreter generate
          machine code that can be directly executed by the machine that is
          running the Java program bytecode is highly optimised set of
          instructions designed to be executed by Java Runtime system called
          'JVM'(Java Virtual Machine).This JVM is different for different
          platform, though it is different it interprets the same Java bytecode.
